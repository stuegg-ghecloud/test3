This README.md was created by a custom probot named **gitstua repo init** when it was installed onto your repository.

Branch protection has been enabled on the **main** branch.

To understand why branch protection can help you ship great software read [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) in the GitHub docs

You may continue to customize the branch protection further based on your needs.
